### Makerspaces

There has long been a Do It Yourself culture in the tech world, where small groups of people would hack at various engineering projects, though this can extend to other topics such as arts. Many do this for fun to intellectually challenge themselves, but many prominent tech companies today started out this way.  Within the past decade, there has been a move from individual garage workshops to community facilities.

A makerspace, or hackspace, is the term for these community workshops, and allow like-minded "hackers" to work in the same place. Makerspaces also contain numerous tools and machines that can aid hackers, such as 3-D printers, electronic tools, and computers. Such resources are normally too expensive for any one individual, especially start-ups, to buy on their own, but is something that can be enjoyed by all the members. Combined with feedback from knowledgeable members, makerspaces are a great resources for start-ups designing their product.

Makerspaces can come in all shapes and sizes. Academic makerspaces are university funding locations for students and alumni. For example, derivatived (us) frequents the [Rutgers Makerspace](http://makerspace.rutgers.edu/). There are private makerspaces, which generally charge a periodic fee to access the space. There may be public days for anyone to visit, and we've visited [FUBAR Labs](http://fubarlabs.org/) a few times during those days.

### Hackathons

Also known as hackfests, hackathons are short, intense events where a large gathering of hackers/makers team up to collaborate on hack projects. Many of projects are done as an educational experience, and sometimes the goal is a viable product. Hackathons usually have sponsors, who help support the event, and may event provide APIs to aid the development process.

### Makerfaires

Makerfaires are events for makers to demonstrate their projects. They usually consist of numerous booths manned by maker organizations, with events such as guest lectures occuring throughout the event. Some of the larger faires event even host competitions like modified power wheel racing. Once example is the World Maker Faire New York 2013.

There are also smaller mini faires, such as the Newark mini-makerfaire April 5 2014.

At DerivativeD we are trying build infrastructure for streaming data analysis. For any meaningful infrastructure we need a good project to work on, after all what’s the point of having a hammer, nails, and wood if you are not going to build a house? Since we are not in the home construction business (well, not anymore for myself at least), we decided that we are going to do something slightly, or much cooler depending on how awesome you are. 

This summer we are embarking on an ambitious project centered around our new meetup group, <a href="http://bit.ly/13D8ca3">Self-Driving Vehicle (SDV)</a>. SDV will focus on installing sensors and computers in a car and building algorithms (this is where you come in!) to get a car to control itself. The goal is to have the virtual environment to test out algorithms built by the end of this summer, and an actual highway test by next year’s summer. Thankfully, Praful was kind enough to donate his car and computers, which saves us loads of time and money. 

We're putting together a team right now to help make this happen. Since we don’t have Tony Stark or Google kind of money, you are absolutely essential as your algorithm intelligence is what makes this mission happen. Luckily, we live in an area that has access to a plethora of people who come from a variety of fields that can be extremely useful in this endeavor. So let's say you're not an algorithmic savant, we're looking for assistance in a variety of fields, including anyone interested in marketing, car mechanics, or people who just want to help build something fun and exciting.

The <a href="bit.ly/12ScLP1">first meeting</a> will be held on Thursday, May 30th. It will feature two notable professors who have helped build a self-driving car.

We're all really excited about doing this, because face it, we all need a Jetson car! More importantly, it'll get Praful (a terrible driver/half-robot) off the road for good.

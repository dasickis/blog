We here at derivatived are realists, we know that this whole self-driving vehicle project will not be all peaches and cream or some other generic metaphor I can’t think of right now. Meaning that, there will be large obstacles that we will have to hurdle throughout the process.

Much like human drivers, autonomous cars will have issues in driving in the snow. <a href="http://bit.ly/YZ8IB4">TransportationIssuesDaily.com</a> recently made a blog post regarding this issue. One of the major issues that many self-driving vehicles rely on sensors that detect objects such as road markers and lanes. However, the snow can obscure these indicators, causing the car to veer off course. Another problem is the hazardous road conditions that come with snow like ice. Experienced drivers have problems with this as is, so it will be interesting to see how the field will address issue.

Another problem is construction zones and accidents. You know this situation, you’re stuck behind a large amount of traffic, where a traffic cop or construction worker are standing there attempting to direct traffic. This can be simple enough for a human to navigate, however the lack of a clear pattern as to who is supposed to go and when, as well as driving into other lanes may prove difficult self-driving vehicles, especially factoring in variables such as emergency vehicles. Henry Blodget from <a href="http://read.bi/XQ49D5">businessinsider.com</a> makes a good point when he states “Imagine pulling up to an intersection in which a police officer is temporarily directing traffic and overriding a traffic light. What should the car pay attention to? How should the car be "taught" to give the police officer's hand signals more weight than the traffic light? How should the car interpret the hand signals, which are often different from person to person? And what if the cop is just pointing at you and yelling, which happens frequently in intersections in New YorkGoogle engineers are apparently working on this issue, how they resolve it remains to be seen”.

Finally aside from all the technical mumbo jumbo, the final issues that self-driving cars are dealing with are the regulatory and legal issues.  First, a minor speed bump is the fact that only three states (Nevada, California, and Florida) have legalized this technology. However, we believe it’s only a matter of time before the rest of the country gets behind the wheel on this issue. The real challenges are quandaries such as who pays if the car malfunctions and runs a red light, or gets into an accident? Is it the owners fault, or does the blame rest in the hands of the developers? In the event of fatalities this topic could become particularly contentious. Or, at what age are people allowed to use these machines? Is it even possible to enforce these laws? What happens to our traffic police officers? Certainly there will be less of a need for them, resulting in some layoffs.  

It is necessary to add that these are just some of the problems that we know of. Some of the biggest problems will be the ones that we do not even know about yet. These will be some of the biggest setbacks due to the fact that they have the ability to completely blindside us and can come from an array of different areas. Still, this is no different from any other technological advancement, including non-autonomous cars.

If you can think any other potential obstacles please add them to the comment section below, we would love to hear from you!

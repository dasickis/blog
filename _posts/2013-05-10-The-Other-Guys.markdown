To continue on with the self-driving vehicle theme from last week, I would like to go into further detail about some of the other projects related to this endeavor. However, since the big companies get enough publicity already (Google, Mercedes, Toyota, Audi, Volkswagen, Ford, GM, Volvo etc), I am going to focus on some of the more small scale projects. These people prove that it is possible to do big things without insane funding.

Chumdan Cha are a Korean based team who make Advanced Driver Assist Systems and lane changing tools. The goal of the company is to create safety devices to help reduce the amount of accidents that happen on the roadway. While their English side of the webpage is fairly small (understandably so, since they speak Korean), they do have some really cool demos on their youtube page. In one instance, a Mrs. Kim <a href="http://bit.ly/16mvyoQ">eats a cup of Ramen Noodles, and peels a fruit</a> whilst driving. Other videos show the car balancing itself to remain in a lane when the driver had their hands off the wheel. Really wish I could understand what they were saying in the video, but it is still worth a look.

The AutoNOMOS team at Freie Universität Berlin are doing something pretty interesting as well. They are developing a self-driving valet service where users can summon a car through the use of an IPad which sends GPS coordinates to a wireless interface built into the vehicle. The car uses a combination of lasers, cameras, and internal computers to detect obstacles and keep the vehicle inside traffic lanes. The group tested their car on September 17th, 2011, <a href="http://bit.ly/ZUaySp">videotaping</a> the car driving itself through traffic from Kaiserdamm to the Brandenburg Gate, even navigating a roundabout. What’s really awesome about the AutoNOMOS team is that don’t stop at just self-driving cars, as they are building a <a href="http://bit.ly/ZUaQZA">self-driving wheelchair</a> as well. Another cool thing about this team is that they are very reliant on students, who by this experience have loads of potential to create big waves in the autonomous vehicle field.

In France, Induct Mobility Solutions are working on creating an electric automated shuttle system for both public and private use called the Navia. The shuttle four laser based Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) units to scan up to 200 yards ahead of the area to read the space around it. The shuttle also uses a system of optical areas that give stereo vision much like a person’s eyes. Together, this combination of technology enables the Navia to create a map of its surroundings. After every trip in a given area, it compares its previous map from the current map, allowing it to independently adapt to its surroundings. Additionally, the vehicles use GPS technologies and sensors to detect its acceleration and axes rotation to instantly calculate its position, route, and distance from the previous point of travel. The website contains this <a href="http://bit.ly/10nLSNV">demo</a> that shows it driving a person to a destination, self-valet parking, and then picking another person up. It also contains dubstep, if you are into that sort of thing (I am, for the most part).

So while some of these companies do have fairly large budgets, it is definitely possible to build a self-driving vehicle without insane capital. Especially if we not only have people who have done this before, but a large dedicated community who will ensure that this will become a reality.

The doctor’s office. The place where you are told to arrive fifteen minutes early, for someone who arrives forty five minutes late, and only speaks to you for five minutes. It can be both a scary and frustrating place, but it’s a necessary burden if you want to, you know, survive. Now imagine a world where many of the traditional doctors are beginning to be phased out. Where instead of a human practitioner giving you their opinion, machines give their diagnosis by factoring in different sets of data to come to a logical conclusion.

<a href="http://bit.ly/Xnpneg">Watson</a>, the same computer made by IBM that eventually was able to dominate Jeopardy, is now trying its luck in the medical field.  The computer will be partnering with Memorial Sloan-Kettering and is designed to help doctors with decision making. The device itself works much in the same way a doctor does, by going through case examples and data to pick the most viable solutions. Typically, it will list all the possible scenarios alongside with confidence intervals for each choice. Just like in Jeopardy where Watson became better the more games it played, the machine will improve in skill over time as it handles more and more cases.

The machine even has the potential to be better than actual living, breathing, carbon-based human doctors. Whereas doctors have to go through tons of “unstructured” data through their years, and then call upon it while interacting with a patient, the supercomputer is able to do this in a moment. This means that there is much less of a chance of missing a potential diagnosis because someone is relying on an already arrived at a certain conclusion. Additionally, many humans fall into what is called “anchoring bias” where they rely too heavily on a single piece of information, while ignoring many other useful facts. In this case doctors may try to fit the diagnosis to match only a few symptoms, when they really should be looking at the bigger picture. Or, they may just treat a few of the symptoms whilst not treating the disease as a whole. Watson would be less likely to fall into these traps.

While the machine is only in trial mode, there is large hopes that it can be extremely useful in fields such as oncology, where the data can be so overwhelming and providing a diagnosis that is both rapid and accurate can be a matter of life or death. With more and more problematic diseases being discovered every day, the usefulness of this device is extremely apparent. In fact, one of the leaders of the IBM team training Watson for health care physician Michael Kohn believes that tools like these will become as common in doctor’s offices as the stethoscope.

Still, this machine is only in its trial run, and would be extremely expensive to implement on a wide scale. But the same can be said with every major improvement. For example, <a href="http://bit.ly/15IUaHG">there is more computing power in a singing birthday card than all of the allied forced in 1945</a>. So, it’s not out of hand to believe that technology will catch up at some point, allowing for computers like Watson to be in most medical offices in the country. 

Our only concern is whether or not this will be one step closer into creating <a href="http://bit.ly/18DKsrE">Skynet</a> and establishing our eventual robot overlords. Luckily we have Arnold on our side.

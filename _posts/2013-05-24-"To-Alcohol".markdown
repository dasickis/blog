Hello again everybody, in the spirit of the holiday weekend this week’s post will involve something most, if not all of you will be consuming this Memorial Day, alcohol. No, it won’t be a review of certain drinks, or will it be a diatribe on how River Horse Brewing Company produces the best craft beer around. Instead, it will involve our theme of autonomous machines working with life’s greatest elixir.

First, MIT Senseable City Lab and Carlo Ratti Associati, an Italian Architecture firm have teamed up to create the <a href="http://bit.ly/13M49pT">“Makr Shakr”</a>, a team of robot bartenders <a href="<a href="http://bit.ly/17L3TNb">that pours your drinks</a> via smart phone orders. The way it operates is attendants of the fair, festival, bar, etc. download the app for their smartphone or tablet device and use it to select what types of drinks and mixers that they desire. The robots three arms then creates whatever concoction that was ordered. The app also allows patrons to see what those around them are ordering so they can order anything they find interesting (and can serve as a conversation starter). Additionally, it tracks exactly how much alcohol each person orders, and could potentially cut people off who have had too much, dramatically decreasing the chances for DUIs (and could save you a load of money as well). The Makr Shakr has recently been used at a Google I/O, and was able to successfully disseminate drinks to a crowd of people.

Now if you are anything like me, you love music festivals. However, receiving beer at these things can be a real pain, because it not only involves a lengthy walk but you have to lose your space in the crowd. Typically, there are not people walking around selling beer a la a baseball game, so what do you do? <a href= "http://bit.ly/139UqMg"You have a robot fly it to you</a> that’s what!

The Oppikoppi festival in South Africa has debuted beer delivery helicopter does just that. Festival-goers place an order for beer, the machine then flies over to the GPS cooridinates of the person who made the order, and then drops the drink via parachute to that location. With the exploding popularity with these types of shows, this technology has a great deal of potential and I believe it’s only a matter of time before these start to become more and more common.

These are just a few of the fun things involving machines and alcohol coming in the future. Who knows, maybe one day they can even mix it with self-driving vehilces in the event we get to the point that there would be zero liability or danger to the public. For the time being, we will have to act like adults and practice restraint, but we can always dream. 

Have a fun and safe Memorial Day Weekend everyone!

Summary: 
This summary is weak as I'm still formulating a good understanding of the
problem. 

Start with a strong culture that people can accept or reject based on DIY
ethics.  Use that to capture interest of a strong community members. This will
result in a strong entrepreneurial community.

Entrepreneurial density (ED) is a measurement of your effort in developing
entrepreneurial ecosystems. The higher the density, the greater the ecosystem
and the more ambitious the projects. However, just understanding the
measurement is unlikely to produce greater returns on effort. 

On the other hand, understanding the job of an entrepreneur will help develop
an environment that provides adequate support to fulfill your goals of
improving ED. My definition of an entrepreneur is a person who is able to
produce unlikely solutions to known problems. The problems have to be known and
the greater the market of sufferers, the greater the demand for a product.
However, the solution has to be unlikely, as the greater a problem there is,
the more people will be solving the issue. 

For example, we always had a problem connecting with people with phrases such
as "lost love" and "out of sight, out of mind". Facebook, however, filled the
problem with their solution which was unlikely to have worked but they started
with a niche audience (college students) with a very specific set of solution
constraints which they generalized to a wider audience.  

Now how do you build an environment where people search for unlikely solutions
instead of obvious implementations, which is what most startups do to mitigate
technical risk? You create environments where difference is celebrated and
failure is cheap. In other words, create a culture that's orthogonal to the one
NJ has and the way to embrace that culture is to seed it with the 10 craziest
people you know and give them what they need to become successful. Use those
case studies to then market it to others and show them how you're committed to
the Think Different crowd. 

This strategy is very difficult to execute due to the fact that the initial
base of people are volatile and incapable of remaining in an environment
non-conducive to their "change shit, break shit" attitude. In essence, you have
to create a movement that is capable of growth but is inherently unstable so
will be short lived. Think of it as a cultural forest fire that needs to
destroy the current thinking and replace it with something new in its wake.
However, it'll be a long process which I think is around a decade. Though
tapping into existing efforts reduces the time to change, but doesn't reduce
the effort burden. 

Look at these movements and the corresponding affect on their respective
communities: 
+ Hippie Movement => What it did for Palo Alto & SF
+ Punk Movement => How it influenced DIY Culture 
+ Hipster Movement => What it's doing in Brooklyn 
+ Hiphop Movement  => The way the members think about work & business

Broader understanding:
+ Countercultures
+ History of Subcultures

All these movements are started as ideologies so they root themselves in
culture (attitude accepted by a group of people), politics (behavior carried
out by a group of people) or religion (irrational belief that's accepted by a
group of people). Then they start to influence fashion (self-expression via
appearances), media (captured self-expression that's transmitted to an
audience), and finally business (self-sustainable self-expression). 

I would start with a divergent culture that's concerned with socioeconomics
(politics) and believes that anyone is capable of global change (religion).
From this core tenant, you'll see people expressing themselves in a variety of
ways which will be dominated by a concern for DIY & self-sustainability i.e.
business. Given there's existing cultures to base your efforts, I'd start to
see how you can expand the efforts instead of initiating a new one. Some new
cultures to look at:
+ Maker Movement
+ Other DIY Subcultures

The weather was picturesque in Central New Jersey and preparations were going so smoothly. Until, of course, extreme downpours suddenly hit right when we were getting ready for our first meetup for the ‘Self Driving Car’. Naturally, we thought this would dampen our prospects of having a successful meetup – until the complete opposite happened. 

Over fifty people ready to listen and discuss our project were in attendance, while another thirty tuned in via the live stream. Our MC, Praful, led the presentation and thanked everyone for being able to come out in spite of the weather before introducing Professor Tyler Folsom, who teleconferenced in from Washington. The professor, accompanied by a video and presentation, talked about his project, Elcano, which is a fully-autonomous tricycle and his experience building a car for the DARPA challenge.

Following Professor Folsom was Professor Rick Anderson from Rutgers University, an expert in using Arduino, printing 3D objects, and building virtual worlds. The Rutgers professor also brought a demonstration that showcased the virtual environment that attendees were able to play with after the presentation.

After the two technical presentations, Praful discussed the timeline and business model behind the project with the meetup group. The goal for the community in the immediate future is to get as many members on board for the open source project, so that the framework for testing will be ready to go by early August. This point turned out to be one of Praful’s major points and was one that left an impression on all in attendance.

After the entire presentation (there was not even a slice of pizza left), attendees were able to mingle, test out the demonstrations themselves, and ask questions to the brains behind the project. When asked by a number of eager developers about the prospects of the project, Praful maintained that if all the short term goals are achieved, by next September, New Jersey will have a highway testable car.

Let’s hope that the weather will be kind to us when that day comes!

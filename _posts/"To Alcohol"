Hello again everybody, in the spirit of the holiday weekend this week’s post will involve something most, if not all of you will be consuming this Memorial Day, alcohol. No, it won’t be a review of certain drinks, or will it be a diatribe on how River Horse Brewing Company produces the best craft beer around. Instead, it will involve our theme of autonomous machines working with life’s greatest elixir.

First, MIT Senseable City Lab and Carlo Ratti Associati, an Italian Architecture firm have teamed up to create the <a href="http://bit.ly/13M49pT">“Makr Shakr”</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/17L3TNb">a team of robot bartenders</a> that pours your drinks via smart phone orders. The way it operates is attendants of the fair, festival, bar, etc. download the app for their smartphone or tablet device and use it to select what types of drinks and mixers that they desire. The robots three arms then creates whatever concoction that was ordered. The app also allows patrons to see what those around them are ordering so they can order anything they find interesting (and can serve as a conversation starter). Additionally, it tracks exactly how much alcohol each person orders, and could potentially cut people off who have had too much, dramatically decreasing the chances for DUIs (and could save you a load of money as well). The Makr Shakr has recently been used at a Google I/O, and was able to successfully disseminate drinks to a crowd of people.
